# https://tasmota.github.io/ble_key_extractor/

This is an adapted version of TeleLinkFLasher by atc1441, adapted to accept a query string containing a MAC address plus a callback URL.

These are used to guide a Tasmota user through obtaining the key for a device detected by Tasmota, and to set the key directly into Tasmota using the callback address.

The user must still record the required Tasmota command for inclusion in any boot script.
